3.	CONSTANT NAMES ARE UPPERCASE 
4.	THERE ARE SPACES AFTER KEYWORDS AND BETWEEN BINARY OPERATORS 
5.	BRACES MUST LINE UP 
6.	NO MAGIC NUMBERS MAY BE USED 
7.	EVERY FUNCTION MUST HAVE A COMMENT 
8.	AT MOST 30 LINES OF CODE MAY BE USED PER FUNCTION 
9.	NO CONTINUE OR BREAK IS ALLOWED 
10.	All data fields must be private
